# The infinite number of primes

This is the first known example of a proof by absurd. 
So, assume to be given a finite set of numbers (that could be the whole set of primes), and let' play with it.

For example, can you construct a natural number which is divisible by any pf them?

And can you construct a natural number bigger than any of them but also not divisible by any of them? 

Finally, given a set of prime numbers and a natural number bigger than any of them but also not divisible by any of them, can you exctract form this number a new prime not contained in the list?

<description for="make_a_new_prime_not_in_the_list">

Takes in input a sequence of prime numbers a constructs a new prime non contained in the list.

Start with:

la_pietra_grezza = make_a_natural_bigger_than_and_not_divisible_by_any_of(n, partial_list_of_primes);
