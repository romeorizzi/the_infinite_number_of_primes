# The infinite number of primes

This is the first known example of a proof by absurd. 
So, assume to be given a finite set of numbers (that could be the whole set of primes), and let' play with it.

For example, can you construct a natural number which is divisible by any pf them?

And can you construct a natural number bigger than any of them but also not divisible by any of them? 

Finally, given a set of prime numbers and a natural number bigger than any of them but also not divisible by any of them, can you exctract form this number a new prime not contained in the list?

Takes in input:

1. a sequence of <param>n</param> prime numbers

2. a natural number number <param>la_pietra_grezza</param> bigger than any of the primes in the list but also not divisible by any of them

and returns:

a new prime non contained in the list.
